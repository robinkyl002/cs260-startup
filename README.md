# Let's Eat!

[My Notes](notes.md)

Let's Eat is a site where you can add and access recipes from anywhere, as well as get suggestions on new recipes. This way there is no need to worry aobut forgetting to print or save a recipe and needing to find it again through a Google search. Perhaps later features can be added to allow sharing with specific people or uploading pictures and having the program create the recipe itself.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever really wanted a specific meal, but didn't have the recipe on hand? Maybe you were planning on making a meal this week, but can't remember what ingredients you need for it when you get to the grocery store. Let's Eat allows you to upload recipes, then pull access them whenever you need. No need to go search the internet for the right recipe. It's already saved and prepared for later.
